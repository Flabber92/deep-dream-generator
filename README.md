# deep-dream-generator

####\#deepdream in a docker environment, to save you 8 hours of setup headaches.


Proper guide to come in the future, as well as tidying up the junk in this repo, but essentially follow what's in the Dockerfile. Command to boot it up is commented at the bottom of the file.

**Note**, issue setting it up in the Dockerfile, but you need to copy `dream.ipynb` to `/notebooks` inside the container.
